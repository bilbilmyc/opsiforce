# Opsiforce

AI coding-assistant platform: users converse with an agent inside a Kubernetes pod to build apps, and can promote those apps from a working environment to production-like environments.

## Language

### Organization

**Organization**:
The top-level customer account a user works inside — owner of its Workspaces, Users, Billing, Defaults, Integrations, and Environment registry. A user may belong to several and switches between them in the selector (shown by display name and a building mark). Its technical name is **tenant** — the `tenants` table, the `*_tenant_*` permissions, the API — which must never surface in user-facing copy. Prefer omitting the noun entirely where context already makes the scope obvious.
_Avoid_: Tenant (internal name only — never user-facing); Account (collides with the user's login); Workspace (a grouping *within* an Organization, not the Organization itself)

**Folder**:
A named, single-level grouping of Projects within a Workspace — an organizational label, not ownership: deleting a Folder releases its Projects to the Workspace; an empty Folder is fine. A Project sits either directly in its Workspace or in exactly one of its Folders, and a Folder's name is unique within its Workspace. Folders exist in shared Workspaces and the private Personal Workspace, never in Public. Moving a Folder to another Workspace carries its Projects and follows the same rules as moving the Projects themselves.
_Avoid_: Group (vague — collides with UI grouping); Directory (filesystem connotation); Subfolder, nested folders (out of scope — one level only)

### Projects & Environments

**Project**:
The durable shell a user owns — identity, ownership, and cross-environment policy. It holds no running state of its own; it groups one or more ProjectEnvironments, each running its own App.
_Avoid_: App (a Project is not the thing that gets built — it groups several; see App)

**Environment**:
A tenant-scoped, named target a Project can run in (name + description). Every tenant has two protected Environments — **Development** and **Production** — created with the tenant; admins add others (e.g. Staging). A protected Environment cannot be renamed or deleted. The set of Environments is the list of publish targets offered to every Project in the tenant.
_Avoid_: Tier, Target, Deployment target

**Environment Slug**:
The short, immutable, URL-safe identifier an Environment carries alongside its name, shown as the environment suffix in an App's public URL. Fixed for the protected Environments (`dev` for Development, `prod` for Production); for a custom Environment it is prefilled from the whole name at creation and editable that one time before saving (it must be unique within the tenant), then immutable — renames never change it, so published URLs outlive renames. The slug is an identifier, not user-facing copy, so the "avoid Prod" rule does not apply to it.
_Avoid_: Suffix (its position in the URL, not the concept); Short name; Code

**Environment Color**:
The color an Organization gives an Environment as its visual identity — the one hue that stands for that Environment wherever environments are shown at a glance (today, the environment markers beside a Project in the sidebar). Every Environment has one: the protected Development and Production Environments are seeded with defaults, and any Environment's color — protected ones included — can be changed by an admin from the Environment registry in Settings. It answers *which* Environment this is, and is deliberately a different axis from the status colors that signal *how* a running environment is doing (active, starting, suspended, failed) — a suspended Production is still "Production" and keeps its color.
_Avoid_: Status color (the orthogonal running-state axis, not identity); Label color; Theme; Tag

**ProjectEnvironment**:
A per-Project instance of an Environment — the thing that actually runs. It owns the runtime state (its files, pod, URLs, and service-gateway key); it shares the Project's LLM virtual keys rather than owning its own. Every Project has one bound to Development; publishing creates additional ones bound to other Environments.
_Avoid_: Instance, Deployment, Env

**Development**:
The default protected Environment present in every tenant. Every Project's working ProjectEnvironment is bound to it. It is never the destination of a publish and cannot be renamed or deleted.
_Avoid_: Dev env, working copy

**Production**:
The second protected Environment present in every tenant — the conventional target for publishing the App's live version. Beyond being guaranteed to exist and protected from rename/delete, it behaves like any other publish target.
_Avoid_: Prod (non-canonical in user-facing copy); Live

**App**:
The application the agent builds inside a ProjectEnvironment, served at that environment's public URL. Each ProjectEnvironment runs its own App, carrying its own App Details — so one Project groups several Apps (one per environment), the same source captured at different published moments. Distinct from the Project (the shell that groups them).
_Avoid_: Project (when you mean the built application); "one App per Project" (retired — each ProjectEnvironment is its own App)

**App Details**:
An App's human-facing identity — its name and description — carried per ProjectEnvironment, since each environment is its own App. First published by the agent when that environment's App goes live, then re-curated by humans against whichever environment they are viewing; the running App reads its own name at runtime. A published App's Details begin as a copy of Development's at publish and evolve independently afterwards.
_Avoid_: App metadata (vague); Project title (the Project shell's label — a different thing); project-level identity (retired — App Details belong to each App/environment, not the Project)

**Go-live**:
The moment an App first exists and is running in a ProjectEnvironment — for Development, when the agent finishes the first feature, it builds and boots, and the agent publishes App Details; for a published environment, when its freshly-deployed pod first serves. Go-live is decoupled from "done": it happens before the agent's feature testing, which follows with the App already live. Each environment goes live independently. Before its App goes live an environment has a pod but no App; that environment's app pane appears only once it happens.
_Avoid_: Detection (the platform's inward-facing name for noticing the same moment); App ready, Launch; Deploy/Publish (which moves an already-live App between Environments)

**Publish**:
The act of materializing or updating a non-Development ProjectEnvironment from the Development one's files, so the App runs in a chosen Environment. Publishing over an already-running environment is a **Publish update**.
_Avoid_: Deploy, Release, Promote, Redeploy

**Duplicate**:
Creating a new Project in the same tenant and workspace from an existing one, preserving its working state in full — App source and history, the agent conversation, the App's databases, Environment Variables, settings, Resources, and App Details. The duplicate is independent: it gets its own keys, and its Schedules arrive **paused** so no automation fires twice. Only the Development ProjectEnvironment is duplicated — published environments are re-created by publishing from the duplicate.
_Avoid_: Copy, Clone, Fork (non-canonical); conflating with Publish (which transports App source only, never working state)

**Export**:
Producing a Project export from a Project's Development working state, to carry it to a *different* Opsiforce deployment. The cross-deployment sibling of Duplicate — same bundle and carry-rules — but the destination is another instance reached through a file rather than a local copy. Only the Development ProjectEnvironment is exported.
_Avoid_: Share; Download (the chat file-download is a different feature); conflating with Publish (which moves App source between Environments within one deployment) or Duplicate (same-deployment copy)

**Import**:
Creating a new, independent Project on this deployment from a Project export — the consume side of Export. The result behaves like a freshly duplicated Project: its own keys, Schedules paused.
_Avoid_: Restore (implies returning to the deployment it left); Upload (the transport, not the act)

**Project export**:
The opaque, versioned file an Export produces and an Import consumes — a sealed copy of a Project's Development working state, meaningful only when imported back into an Opsiforce deployment, never read or edited on its own.
_Avoid_: Workflow (colloquial — maps to no entity; the exported unit is a Project); Workspace export (Workspace is the Org-level project grouping, a different thing); Blueprint, Template, Package (non-canonical)

**Active environment**:
The one ProjectEnvironment the project workspace is currently showing — chat, code, DB, and the app pane all follow it. Chosen by clicking an environment in the Environments panel, or via **View environment** after a Publish completes; defaults to Development. Viewing changes nothing about the environment itself — it only re-points the workspace.
_Avoid_: Current env, Selected env (spell out "environment"); conflating with Development (the default, not a synonym)

**Environment Variables**:
The per-ProjectEnvironment configuration values (string keys and values) the App reads when it starts — API keys, base URLs, flags. Each ProjectEnvironment carries its own set; values are set at publish or edited directly per environment, and changes take effect only when the App restarts.
_Avoid_: Secrets (they may hold secrets but are not only secrets); the pod's process env (platform plumbing, a different thing)

**Restart (environment)**:
Recreating a ProjectEnvironment's pod from scratch — the row-level Restart action. Distinct from the lighter **App restart** that applying Environment Variables performs, which restarts only the App's processes inside the running pod.
_Avoid_: Reboot; conflating with App restart

**App Auth**:
Per-ProjectEnvironment control over how visitors sign in to the App at that environment's URL — one of **public** (anyone), **manual** (the owner's own OIDC provider), or **managed** (a shared identity provider configured by the platform operator, scoped to the tenant). Each ProjectEnvironment carries its own; a newly published environment is **seeded once** from Development's setting at first publish, then managed independently per environment.
_Avoid_: Project auth (it is not project-wide — each environment has its own); Login, SSO (non-canonical)

**Auth mode**:
The chosen App Auth setting for one ProjectEnvironment — `public`, `manual`, or `managed` (the stored identifier is `auth_mode`).
_Avoid_: Auth type, Auth provider

**Resources**:
The CPU/memory size of a Project's agent pod, chosen as a class — Small, Medium, Large, or Custom. A project-level policy: one choice applies to every one of the Project's ProjectEnvironment pods (Development and any published target alike).
_Avoid_: Pod class (the internal identifier — never user-facing); Environment size (collides with Environment); Tier, Machine size, Compute (non-canonical — say Resources)

### Agents

**Agent**:
The AI coding assistant a user converses with inside a ProjectEnvironment's pod. The platform ships one — **app-builder** — as the default. An Agent is a profile: identity, instructions, skills, and the Model it runs on.
_Avoid_: Bot, Assistant (non-canonical)

**Agent Model**:
The LLM an Agent runs on. In Bifrost deployments, channels and models are discovered from Bifrost; platform administrators select a persistent default and users select a model for their conversation. Channel changes are synchronized without rebuilding the agent image. Standalone deployments retain the agent-config fallback. See ADR 0033.

**Agent Status**:
Whether an Agent is **Working** — processing a run it was prompted to do, including any mid-run provider retries — or **Idle** (no run in flight; a suspended or absent pod is simply Idle, not a third state). Carried per ProjectEnvironment, since each environment has its own Agent; a Project counts as Working when any of its environments' Agents is, shown at-a-glance beside the project in the sidebar. Distinct from Keep-alive's *agent activity*, which is the user's traffic touching the pod — not the Agent thinking.
_Avoid_: Agent activity (a Keep-alive kind — user-driven traffic, a different concept); Busy (the engine's wire value, not user-facing copy); Running (collides with pod lifecycle)

**Prompt**:
The single chat input a user composes and sends to the Agent — one turn's worth of instruction. Sending a Prompt is the canonical act of interacting with a Project's Agent, distinct from merely viewing or navigating the Project.
_Avoid_: Message (ambiguous — also covers the Agent's reply); Query, Command

**Dictation**:
Speaking into the chat instead of typing — a recording made from the prompt's mic button is transcribed to text and inserted into the prompt draft for review; nothing is sent until the user sends. The audio is transient input, never a stored artifact. The spoken language is auto-detected by default, with an explicit per-browser language override.
_Avoid_: Voice message (implies the audio itself is attached or kept); Voice chat, Speech-to-text (the mechanism, not the feature); Transcription (the backend step, not the user-facing act)

### Files

**Files**:
The project workspace tab where a user sees and manages the Active environment's workspace files — User uploads, Generated files, and any stray files the Agent left at the workspace root — with folder drill-down and breadcrumbs. Visible to every project member; the App's source, platform data, and dotfiles never appear in it.
_Avoid_: File browser, File manager (dev-tool connotation — it is a curated view, not the filesystem); Workspace (the Org-level Project grouping — a different thing)

**User uploads**:
Files a user added to a ProjectEnvironment — attached in chat or uploaded from the Files tab — kept durably in the environment's upload area with their original folder layout preserved.
_Avoid_: Attachments (implies message-scoped; uploads are durable workspace files, not parts of a Prompt)

**Generated files**:
The Agent's finished deliverables — documents, reports, exports — saved by convention into the environment's designated output folder, which the Files tab surfaces as its own section. The folder comes into existence on first write; deliverables the Agent drops elsewhere still surface in the tab as other files.
_Avoid_: Artifacts (claude.ai's concept — different mechanics); Outputs (vague); Generated app (the App source — a different thing entirely)

**File preview**:
Reading a finished workspace file in the project's right side panel instead of downloading it — opened by clicking a file link the Agent posted in chat, or a file in the Files tab. It shares the panel with the App preview through an App | File switcher, shows one file at a time, and never opens or switches modes on its own. Formats outside the supported set are not an error state: they offer a download instead.
_Avoid_: Artifact preview (implies claude.ai's streaming artifacts; this is finished files only); Viewer, File viewer (suggests a separate surface — it is the same panel the App preview uses); App preview (the running App in that panel — the other mode, not this one)

**Document conversion**:
Turning a Word or PowerPoint deliverable into a PDF so File preview can render it, on a shared in-cluster converter the Agent cannot reach. It runs as a job — the panel is told a conversion is pending, then shown the PDF — and the result is transient, so reopening the same file converts it again. An unconvertible document offers a download instead of failing.
_Avoid_: Export (the Project Export & Import feature — a different thing); Rendering (the browser-side half of File preview); Caching, Cached PDF (there is no conversion cache — results are job plumbing)

### Schedules

**Schedule**:
A recurring cron job an agent registers against an endpoint in the App, owned by **one ProjectEnvironment** — it fires only against that environment's running App. Publishing copies Development's chosen schedules into the target environment, so a same-named schedule can exist and fire **independently** in several environments (the copies are intentional, not duplicates).
_Avoid_: Cron job (the mechanism, not the domain concept); Job (collides with BullMQ jobs and publish jobs)

### Request Logging

**Request Logging**:
Per-Project control over how much of its App's live traffic the app-mode proxy records to the Project's request log. Owner-set policy, alongside Resources, budgets, and timeouts.
_Avoid_: Access logging, tracing, audit log

**Logging level**:
The chosen verbosity — Off (record nothing), Metadata (method, path, status, latency, size, redacted headers; no bodies), or Full (metadata plus a bounded prefix of each body). An ordered scale from least to most recorded.
_Avoid_: Mode (the stored identifier `request_log_mode`); log level (in the DEBUG/INFO sense)

**Body limit**:
The byte cap on how much of each request/response body the Full level captures before truncating. The log holds a prefix, never the whole body.
_Avoid_: Buffer size, max body size (collides with upload limits)

### Runtime

**Keep-alive activity**:
The traffic that keeps a ProjectEnvironment's pod running, of two kinds: **agent activity** — the user working through the agent (chat, the code editor, the database viewer, file uploads) — and **app activity** — the running App's own traffic (its public and preview URLs, and scheduled runs). Each kind has its own idle timeout; the pod is suspended only once both kinds have been idle past their timeouts. "Why a pod is still alive" is always one of these two, never a finer reason.
_Avoid_: Chat (one input to agent activity, not a category of its own); Heartbeat, Ping (non-canonical)

### Administration

**Settings**:
The permission-gated surface where a member **configures** the Organization currently chosen in the selector — its Workspaces, Users, Billing, Defaults, Integrations, and Environment registry. One destination with one section per area; each section is independently gated, so a member sees only the areas they may manage. It changes stored configuration; the running-state counterpart is Admin.
_Avoid_: Tenant Settings (retired user-facing label — the old modal that held only Integrations + Environments); Config (non-canonical); Admin (the operational sibling — a separate destination, not a synonym for Settings); conflating with Defaults (one section within Settings, not the whole)

**Admin**:
The permission-gated surface where a member **observes and operates** running state — the counterpart to Settings, which configures it. A sibling destination reached from the avatar dropdown, built on the same left-rail layout (one page per area, each independently gated). Most pages show the Organization currently chosen in the selector (Pods, Usage); a page gated by a Platform-scope permission shows all Organizations at once and ignores the selector. Its first page is Pods. The test for where a view belongs: if it shows or acts on what is running now, it is Admin; if it changes stored configuration, it is Settings.
_Avoid_: Settings (the configuration sibling — a different destination); Admin panel, Console, Operations, Monitoring (non-canonical — say Admin); conflating with Pods (the first page within Admin, not the whole)

**Platform-scope permission**:
A permission whose view spans **all Organizations** rather than the one chosen in the selector — the `platform_` segment in its name marks the scope (e.g. `can_view_platform_storage`). Granting one is granting cross-Organization visibility, so its Keycloak group is never part of the default admin bundle. There is no "super admin": cross-Organization capability is a property of individual permissions, not of a role.
_Avoid_: Super admin, Global admin (role concepts — the system has only flat permissions); Cross-tenant permission (say Platform-scope)

**Storage**:
The Admin view of disk usage on the shared volume — one measured number per ProjectEnvironment directory, rolled up Environment → Project → Organization, plus Unattributed storage, reconciled against the volume's actual usage. Gated by a Platform-scope permission, so it shows all Organizations and ignores the selector. Read-only, current-state snapshot; sizes may lag recent writes.
_Avoid_: Disk usage, Quota (no quotas exist — the view only observes); Usage (the external-services Admin page — a different thing); Storage view per Organization (Platform-scope by definition)

**Pending deletion**:
Disk usage from an Organization's deleted Projects and ProjectEnvironments whose directories are retained until cleanup retention expires. Attributed to the Organization — it answers "why is this Organization's total bigger than the sum of its projects" — as one aggregate per Organization, never itemized (the project record is gone; a bare directory identifier tells an operator nothing).
_Avoid_: Tombstoned (reserve for directories attributable to no Organization); Deleted storage (non-canonical)

**Unattributed storage**:
Disk usage on the shared volume that belongs to no Organization: the **pool** (live unclaimed pool projects), **tombstoned** (retained deleted directories whose record names no Organization), **orphaned** (directories matching no record at all), **exports** and **imports** (transient archives), and **unaccounted** (the computed residual between everything measured and the volume's actual usage). An Organization's own retained deleted directories are NOT unattributed — they are its Pending deletion.
_Avoid_: Platform storage (reads as "all storage on the platform", which this is not); System storage (non-canonical); Orphaned (one bucket within, not the whole)

**Pods**:
The view of an Organization's running environment pods — one row per running ProjectEnvironment, grouped by Project — showing each pod's status, age, Resources, configured timeouts, and live Keep-alive activity (when it was last kept alive and by which kind). Read-only; the first page within Admin.
_Avoid_: Pod class (the Resources identifier — a different thing); Resources (the size policy, not the running instances); Instances (non-canonical)
