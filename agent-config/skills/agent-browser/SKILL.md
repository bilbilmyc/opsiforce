# agent-browser

Browser automation tool for testing your app and debugging UI issues. Chrome/Chromium via CDP with accessibility-tree snapshots and compact `@eN` element refs.

## Discovering commands

Don't guess at commands — ask the CLI. It serves version-matched docs so instructions never go stale:

```bash
agent-browser skills list                 # every skill available on the installed version
agent-browser skills get core             # workflows, common patterns, troubleshooting
agent-browser skills get core --full      # full command reference and templates
agent-browser --help                      # top-level help
agent-browser <command> --help            # help for a specific command
```

Run `agent-browser skills get core --full` before your first interaction in a session — it has the canonical commands for navigating, snapshotting, clicking, filling, waiting, network inspection, and evaluating JS in the page.

## Debugging workflow

**Before opening the browser**, verify the dev servers are running (run `cd /workspace/app && yarn check`, then check for recent crashes/errors — the queries are in the `sqlite` skill, §Platform observability DB). A blank page is almost always a crashed process, not a UI bug.

When investigating UI issues, pair browser output with those platform-DB queries:

1. Open the app at `http://localhost:3000` — see what the user sees
2. Take a snapshot to inspect the DOM
3. Query `app_requests` for failed API calls (4xx/5xx + response body)
4. Query `process_logs` / `process_events` for dev-server errors or crashes
