description: SQLite database via Node 24's built-in node:sqlite — migrations, DatabaseService API, full-text search (FTS5), and the read-only platform databases (observability, inbound external-service messages). Use for any data model change, schema work, or SQL query. Every data model change starts here with a migration file.

# SQLite

The app uses Node 24's built-in `node:sqlite` (`DatabaseSync`). Synchronous API, zero dependencies, no native compile step. Imported as `import { DatabaseSync } from "node:sqlite"`. Database file is at `data/app.db`.

There is also a per-project platform-managed observability database at `/workspace/data/database.db` (tables: `app_requests`, `process_logs`, `process_events`). Do not create tables or write to it — always open with `sqlite3 -readonly /workspace/data/database.db "..."`. When debugging a failed request, crash, or error, Read references/observability-db.md — it has the platform DB schema and ready-to-run queries.

## Inbound messages — `/workspace/data/external-services.db`

A third platform-managed file holds inbound messages from external services (incoming email, WhatsApp). **The platform backend is the only writer** — agents, app code, and the DB viewer are read-only. Never create tables, write, or run migrations against it; open it with `sqlite3 -readonly` or `new DatabaseSync(path, { readOnly: true })`.

The schema is **fixed and the same for every service** — two tables, created lazily the first time any message arrives. Until then the file is empty, which is normal: "no such table: messages" means "nothing has arrived yet", not a broken setup.

```sql
CREATE TABLE messages (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  service TEXT NOT NULL,               -- 'incoming-email', 'whatsapp', …
  received_at TEXT NOT NULL,           -- when the platform stored it (ISO)
  raw_payload TEXT NOT NULL,           -- the provider's original payload, as received
  app_delivered_at TEXT,               -- when the app's doorbell handler ACKed; NULL = never
  provider_message_id TEXT NOT NULL,   -- unique per service: a replayed delivery is a no-op
  routing_key TEXT NOT NULL,           -- what the message was addressed to (email recipient, chat id)
  sender TEXT,                         -- who sent it
  text_body TEXT,                      -- the message text
  payload TEXT NOT NULL                -- JSON: everything service-specific
);
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX messages_service_provider_message_id ON messages (service, provider_message_id);

CREATE TABLE attachments (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  message_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES messages (id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  filename TEXT,
  content_type TEXT,
  size_bytes INTEGER NOT NULL,
  content BLOB                         -- NULL = the platform could not fetch the bytes; the row still exists
);
```

Two consequences to write queries around:

- **Always filter by `service`.** Every service's messages share the table, so a query without `WHERE service = '…'` mixes email and WhatsApp rows.
- **`routing_key` / `sender` / `text_body` mean the same thing everywhere**, which is what keeps hot queries plain SQL. Everything else is in `payload` and comes out with `json_extract` — the per-service field inventory lives in that service's own skill:

```sql
SELECT id, received_at, sender, text_body,
       json_extract(payload, '$.subject') AS subject
  FROM messages
 WHERE service = 'incoming-email'
 ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 20;
```

`app_delivered_at` is the "was the app rung?" signal. Delivery is a single fire-and-forget attempt with no retries, so `NULL` rows are the ones the app has not processed — the handler isn't implemented (the app template's catch-all stub answers 501), it returned a non-2xx, or the pod was cold when the message landed. Reading undelivered rows is how an app catches up, and it is the first thing to check when a message "never arrived":

```typescript
import { DatabaseSync } from "node:sqlite"

const db = new DatabaseSync("/workspace/data/external-services.db", { readOnly: true })
const pending = db
  .prepare("SELECT * FROM messages WHERE service = ? AND app_delivered_at IS NULL ORDER BY id")
  .all("incoming-email")
```

The handler contract and each service's `payload` fields live in that service's own skill (`incoming-email`, `whatsapp`) — load it before wiring an app to a service.

## DatabaseService API

Inject in any NestJS service:

```typescript
import { DatabaseService } from "../database/database.service"

constructor(private readonly db: DatabaseService) {}
```

### Methods — complete reference (do not invent methods not listed here)

| Method | Returns | Use for |
|---|---|---|
| `queryAll<T>(sql, params?)` | `T[]` | SELECT multiple rows |
| `queryOne<T>(sql, params?)` | `T \| undefined` | SELECT single row |
| `run(sql, params?)` | `{ changes, lastInsertRowid }` | INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE |
| `exec(sql)` | `void` | Raw SQL (DDL, multiple statements) |

### Examples

```typescript
// SELECT all
const items = this.db.queryAll<Item>("SELECT * FROM items WHERE status = ?", ["active"])

// SELECT one
const item = this.db.queryOne<Item>("SELECT * FROM items WHERE id = ?", [id])

// INSERT
const result = this.db.run("INSERT INTO items (title) VALUES (?)", ["New item"])
const newId = result.lastInsertRowid

// UPDATE
this.db.run("UPDATE items SET title = ?, updated_at = datetime('now') WHERE id = ?", ["Updated", id])

// DELETE
this.db.run("DELETE FROM items WHERE id = ?", [id])

// COUNT
const { count } = this.db.queryOne<{ count: number }>("SELECT COUNT(*) as count FROM items")!
```

## Creating tables — migrations

Create `.sql` files in `backend/src/migrations/`:

```
backend/src/migrations/
  001_create_items.sql     ← existing (do not modify)
  002_create_tasks.sql     ← your new migration
  003_add_categories.sql   ← another migration
```

### Rules

- Files run in alphabetical order, each only once
- Migrations run **automatically on every boot** (dev and production), each in its **own transaction** (the whole file commits, or rolls back on error). Once a migration has run it is recorded and skipped forever.
- **Never modify an existing migration** — it has already been applied and won't re-run; editing it has no effect (and in production would diverge environments). Every schema change is a **new** file.
- **Never modify the existing `items` table** — create your own tables
- Naming: `NNN_description.sql`

### Migration template

```sql
CREATE TABLE tasks (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  completed INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  priority TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'medium',
  due_date TEXT,
  created_at TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT (datetime('now')),
  updated_at TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT (datetime('now'))
);
```

### Common patterns

```sql
-- Foreign key
CREATE TABLE comments (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  task_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES tasks(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  body TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT (datetime('now'))
);

-- Index for performance
CREATE INDEX idx_comments_task_id ON comments(task_id);

-- Unique constraint
CREATE TABLE users (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  email TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  name TEXT NOT NULL
);

-- Alter table (add column)
ALTER TABLE tasks ADD COLUMN assigned_to TEXT;
```

### Data types

- `TEXT` — strings, dates (ISO format via `datetime('now')`)
- `INTEGER` — numbers, booleans (0/1)
- `REAL` — floating point
- `BLOB` — binary data

## Transactions (batch operations — 10-100x faster)

```typescript
this.db.exec("BEGIN")
try {
  for (const item of items) {
    this.db.run("INSERT INTO items (title) VALUES (?)", [item.title])
  }
  this.db.exec("COMMIT")
} catch (e) {
  this.db.exec("ROLLBACK")
  throw e
}
```

**Always** wrap in try/catch with ROLLBACK. Without it, a failed insert leaves the transaction open and blocks writes.

## UPSERT (insert or update)

```sql
INSERT INTO settings (key, value) VALUES (?, ?)
  ON CONFLICT(key) DO UPDATE SET value = excluded.value, updated_at = datetime('now');
```

Requires a UNIQUE constraint on the conflict column.

## Full-text search (FTS5)

```sql
-- Migration: create FTS table
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE items_fts USING fts5(title, description);

-- Trigger to keep in sync
CREATE TRIGGER items_ai AFTER INSERT ON items BEGIN
  INSERT INTO items_fts(rowid, title, description) VALUES (new.id, new.title, new.description);
END;
CREATE TRIGGER items_ad AFTER DELETE ON items BEGIN
  DELETE FROM items_fts WHERE rowid = old.id;
END;
CREATE TRIGGER items_au AFTER UPDATE ON items BEGIN
  DELETE FROM items_fts WHERE rowid = old.id;
  INSERT INTO items_fts(rowid, title, description) VALUES (new.id, new.title, new.description);
END;
```

```typescript
// Search
this.db.queryAll(`
  SELECT i.* FROM items i
  JOIN items_fts fts ON i.id = fts.rowid
  WHERE items_fts MATCH ?
  ORDER BY rank
`, [searchQuery])
```

## JSON support

```sql
-- Store JSON in a TEXT column
INSERT INTO items (metadata) VALUES ('{"color":"blue","tags":["work","urgent"]}');

-- Query JSON fields
SELECT *, json_extract(metadata, '$.color') as color FROM items
WHERE json_extract(metadata, '$.active') = 1;

-- JSON array operations
SELECT * FROM items WHERE json_array_length(json_extract(metadata, '$.tags')) > 0;
```

## Window functions

```sql
-- Row numbering
SELECT *, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY created_at DESC) as row_num FROM items;

-- Running total
SELECT *, SUM(amount) OVER (ORDER BY created_at) as running_total FROM transactions;

-- Rank within groups
SELECT *, RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY category ORDER BY score DESC) as category_rank FROM items;
```

## Common aggregate patterns

```sql
-- Group by with counts
SELECT status, COUNT(*) as count FROM tasks GROUP BY status;

-- Group by date (day)
SELECT date(created_at) as day, COUNT(*) as count FROM items GROUP BY date(created_at) ORDER BY day DESC;

-- Group by month
SELECT strftime('%Y-%m', created_at) as month, COUNT(*) as count FROM items GROUP BY month ORDER BY month DESC;
```

## Performance

- `PRAGMA journal_mode = TRUNCATE` — already set for CephFS compatibility
- `PRAGMA synchronous = FULL` — already set for durability; avoid long write transactions
- `CREATE INDEX idx_items_status ON items(status)` — always index columns used in WHERE/ORDER BY
- `EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN SELECT ...` — run to debug slow queries
- Wrap batch inserts in BEGIN/COMMIT (10-100x faster than individual inserts)
- Use `LIMIT` and `OFFSET` for pagination: `SELECT * FROM items ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 20 OFFSET 40`

## Common mistakes

1. **Not indexing foreign keys** — SQLite doesn't auto-index FK columns. Always `CREATE INDEX idx_comments_task_id ON comments(task_id)`.
2. **Forgetting ROLLBACK** — if an error happens mid-transaction without ROLLBACK, the transaction stays open and blocks writes.
3. **Using `LIKE '%query%'` for search** — full table scan. Use FTS5 for text search.
